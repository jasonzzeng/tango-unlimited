## 🧠 About

Tango Unlimited is a full-stack front-end puzzle engine that:

* Generates valid boards algorithmically
* Guarantees a unique solution
* Supports multiple difficulty levels
* Allows customizable board sizes (4x4 → 12x12)
* Includes an intelligent hint system
* Detects errors in real-time without disrupting layout
* Tracks solve time and displays a completion screen

This project was built to demonstrate:

* Advanced logic constraint solving
* Backtracking algorithms
* Deterministic puzzle generation
* State management in React
* Clean UI architecture
* Automated CI deployment via GitHub Actions

## 🛠 How It Works (High-Level)

1. Generate a valid completed grid via backtracking.
2. Add relational constraints (`=` and `×`) based on solution.
3. Remove cells while preserving uniqueness.
4. Enforce constraints dynamically during gameplay.
5. Validate win state in real-time.
